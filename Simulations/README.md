# Strategies

This folder contains the statistical evaluation of strategy matchups generated by the simulation engine.
The purpose is to compare strategies at a statistically significant level and document the conclusions drawn from the simulations.

## How the Simulations Were Executed

### Strategies Compared
- Random
- Greedy
- SafeChoice
- MCTS (time-limited to 0.3 seconds per move)
- Minimax (Alpha–Beta)

All strategies from the folder `Strategies` were evaluated against each other for every board size.

---

### Board Sizes
Simulations were run on the following board dimensions:

3×3, 5×5, 6×6, 8×8, 9×9

Each board size uses the same number of sample boards.

### Eliminating First-Mover Bias
To remove structural advantages:

- Each board is played twice  
  - Game 1: Strategy A starts  
  - Game 2: Strategy B starts  

This ensures symmetric matchups and allows accurate measurement of first-move advantage.

### Statistical Sample Size Justification

The target was to achieve a 97% confidence interval with 3% margin of error for win-rate estimates. Because each game is an independent Bernoulli trial 
(win/loss, with ties treated separately), the win rate follows a binomial distribution.

Using the binomial CI formula:

$$
n = \frac{z^2 p(1-p)}{h^2}
$$

with

- z = 2.17 (97% CI)  
- p = 0.5 (worst-case variance)  
- h = 0.03 

This results in:

$$
n \approx 1308 \text{ independent games}
$$

Because each board is played twice:

$$
\text{Boards needed} = \frac{1308}{2} = 654
$$

Distributed equally across 5 board sizes:

$$
\approx 132 \text{ boards per size}
$$

Thus every board dimension uses 132 random boards to meet statistical significance.

### Implementation Notes

**MCTS Time Limit**
To keep the full simulation runtime manageable, the MCTS strategy was restricted to:

0.3 seconds per move

### `Aggregate Win , Tie , Loss.png`

This stacked bar chart summarizes the overall performance of each strategy across all matchups and board sizes.

- Minimax, SafeChoice, and MCTS show the strongest overall Win proportions (green), indicating their effectiveness across the test space. Minimax has the highest win rate at about 75%.
- Random performs very poorly, with a win rate of approximately 3% and a massive loss rate (red) of over 95%, as expected for an uninformed strategy.
- Greedy shows moderate performance with a nearly 50% win rate.
- The proportion of Tie results (yellow) is minimal for most strategies, suggesting that the game rarely results in a draw against these opponents.

### `First-Move Advantage Heatmap.png` and `first move adv per board size.png`

These plots analyze the Starter Win Rate (the win rate when the strategy moves first) across different board sizes.

- Strong First-Move Advantage: For all more complex strategies (Greedy, MCTS, Minimax, SafeChoice), starting first provides a significant advantage, particularly on smaller boards (3x3 and 5x5), where win rates are consistently above 80% (e.g., MCTS is 0.900 on 3x3).
- Declining Advantage with Board Size: As the Board Size increases (from 3x3 to 9x9), the first-move advantage generally decreases for all strategies. The line plot clearly shows a downward trend, suggesting larger boards allow more room for complex counterplay to overcome the opening advantage.
- Random Baseline: The Random strategy's starter win rate remains close to 0.500 across all board sizes, confirming the underlying symmetry of the game when neither player employs a strong strategy.

### `Strategy vs Strategy Win Rates.png`

This heatmap shows the direct head-to-head win rate of the strategy (row) against the opponent (column).

- Minimax Dominance: The Minimax strategy is the most dominant, achieving high win rates against all other competitors: 0.73 vs Greedy, 0.64 vs MCTS, and 0.98 vs Random.
- MCTS and SafeChoice Performance: MCTS and SafeChoice are strong, but slightly less dominant than Minimax in head-to-head comparisons against other informed strategies. They both reliably beat Random with a win rate of 0.97 and 0.98, respectively.
- Random's Weakness: Random is consistently and heavily outperformed, with its highest win rate being a mere 0.023 against Greedy.

### `Strategy-OpponentBoardSize.png`

This matrix details the win rate of the main strategies against opponents of the same strategy but on specific board sizes.

- Minimax Scalability: Minimax demonstrates exceptional scaling with board size, achieving a win rate of 91.7% against Minimax on the 9x9 board. This indicates its deep search is highly effective as the game complexity increases.
- MCTS Performance: MCTS maintains strong performance but shows a slight drop on the largest boards (e.g., 53.4% vs MCTS on 9x9), likely due to the strict 0.3s time limit preventing a sufficiently deep search in a massive search space.
- Opponent's Role: Against the Random opponent, all informed strategies achieve near-perfect win rates (100.0%) across almost all board sizes, highlighting the vast difference in capability.
- Greedy and SafeChoice: These strategies show moderate, board-size-dependent performance, generally declining or stabilizing as board size increases, unlike Minimax.

### `win rate per board size.png`

This line plot visualizes how the overall win rate of each strategy changes as the board size increases.

- Minimax Improvement: Minimax is the only strategy whose win rate increases significantly with board size, rising from about 62% on 3x3 to over 95% on 9x9. This is the clearest evidence of its strength in exploiting deep search spaces.
- MCTS Performance: MCTS performs well on small-to-mid boards but its win rate begins to drop slightly on 8x8 and 9x9, reflecting the constraint limitations seen in the previous plot.
- SafeChoice Stability: The SafeChoice strategy maintains a stable or slightly improving win rate across increasing board sizes, hovering around 60% to 68%. This suggests its approach is robust and scales reasonably well with complexity.
- Greedy Decline: The Greedy strategy's win rate steadily declines as the board size increases, dropping from about 55% to under 45%, suggesting its simple heuristic struggles with growing complexity.
- Random Collapse: The Random strategy's win rate rapidly drops to near-zero on boards larger than 5x5, confirming it is non-viable in complex game states.
